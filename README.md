Creative and solution-driven full-stack software engineer with a background in education. After graduating from Wilmington University in Winter 2015, I worked in the Wicomico County Public School system for 4 years as an elementary educator. I then moved to the DC area in Spring 2019 where I began teaching English to China-based students through VIPKid. When I transitioned to Flatiron School, I took my skills gained from my education background and applied them to learn Ruby, Rails, SQL, Javascript, and React.

In my free time, I like to go on hikes, walk my two pugs, try new icecream and coffee shops, and care for plants, lots and lots of plants!
